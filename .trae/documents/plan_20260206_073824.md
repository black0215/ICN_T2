I will modify `ModernModWindow.xaml.cs` to adjust the background transitions as requested.

### 1. Revert Modding Menu to Original State (Small/Compact)
The Modding Menu is currently set to an "Expanded" state by default, causing the "shrink then expand" jerkiness when moving to the Tool Window.
- **Action**: In `TransitionToModdingMenu`, change the layout initialization to "False" (Collapsed/Original).
  - `AnimateSteppedLayout(true)` → `AnimateSteppedLayout(false)`
  - `UIAnimationsRx.AnimateLayout(..., true, ...)` → `UIAnimationsRx.AnimateLayout(..., false, ...)`

### 2. Fix Tool Window Transition (Expand on Entry)
By starting from the "Original" state in the Modding Menu, the transition to the Tool Window will naturally expand instead of shrinking first.
- **Mechanism**:
  - `PlaySelectionAnimation` (Transition start) calls `AnimateSteppedLayout(false)`. Since we are now already in `false` state, this will cause no visible change (no shrink).
  - `ShowCharacterInfoContent` (Tool Open) calls `AnimateSteppedLayout(true)`. This will trigger the **Expansion** exactly when the tool content appears.
- **Result**: The background will stay compact during the medal animation and then **expand smoothly together with the tool window**, as requested.

### 3. Smooth Reverse Transition (Back to Modding)
When returning from the Tool Window to the Modding Menu, the background should shrink back to the "Original" state.
- **Action**: In `GoBack`, change the layout restoration logic.
  - `AnimateSteppedLayout(true)` → `AnimateSteppedLayout(false)`

This ensures a consistent cycle:
**Modding (Small)** → *Expand* → **Tool (Large)** → *Shrink* → **Modding (Small)**.
