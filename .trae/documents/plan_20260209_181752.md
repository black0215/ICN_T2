# Modern UI Refactoring Plan for Character Basic Info

I will update `CharacterInfoV3.xaml` to implement the requested "iPhone + Windows 11" style and fix the layout issues.

### 1. Disable "Upward Expansion"
*   **Action**: Remove the `Margin="0,-90,0,10"` from the top Grid in the Right Content area.
*   **Result**: This will stop the content from floating upwards and overlapping/expanding into the header space, ensuring a stable, downward-flowing layout.

### 2. Layout Readjustment & Styling (iPhone + Win11)
I will redesign the layout using a **Card-based Dashboard** approach with the following style guide:

*   **Container Style (Win11 Mica/Acrylic Simulation)**:
    *   Use `CornerRadius="16"` or `"20"` for main containers (Squircle-ish).
    *   Backgrounds will use semi-transparent white (`#80FFFFFF` to `#B0FFFFFF`) with `DropShadowEffect` (Blur 20, Opacity 0.1) to create depth.
    *   Subtle borders (`#20000000`) for definition.

*   **Typography (iOS/Modern Clean)**:
    *   Headers: Centered, Bold, `FontSize="14-16"`, `Opacity="0.6"`.
    *   Values: `FontFamily="Consolas"` for Hashes, System font for text.

*   **Structure Changes**:
    *   **Left Panel (Search)**:
        *   Remove `MaxHeight` restriction to allow it to fill the available space comfortably or adapt to content.
        *   Keep the floating style but align it better with the right content.
    *   **Right Panel (Content)**:
        *   **Top Section**: Character Identity Card (Icon, Name, Rank/Tribe Toggles).
        *   **Middle Section**:
            *   **Medal Card**: Visual representation of the medal position.
            *   **Hash/Data Card**: Technical details (BaseHash, IDs) in a clean list.
        *   **Bottom Section**:
            *   **Food Card**: Favorite/Hated food selectors.
            *   **Description Card**: Full-width text area with rounded corners.

### 3. Implementation Details
*   **File**: `ICN_T2/UI/WPF/Views/CharacterInfoV3.xaml`
*   **Key Changes**:
    *   Replace `Grid` rows with a cleaner `DockPanel` or `Grid` with star-sizing.
    *   Update all `Border` elements to match the new `CornerRadius` and `Effect` styles.
    *   Ensure `Tribe` and `Rank` selectors (Popups) match the new aesthetic.

This plan addresses both the specific fix (upward expansion) and the stylistic overhaul.
